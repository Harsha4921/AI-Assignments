# AI Assignment 1 – Search Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 of the Artificial Intelligence course. The task was to solve two classic problems using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

### Problems Covered
1. Bridge Crossing Problem – implemented in `Bridgecross.py`
2. Rabbit Leap Problem – implemented in `Rabbitleap.py`

## How to Run the Programs
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
You can run the files using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
